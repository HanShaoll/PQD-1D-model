# PQD-1D-model
This repository contains:

1. A simulated Power Quality Disturbance (PQD) database

2. 1D multi-label classification code implementations using ResNet, MobileNet, and DenseNet in Keras, with pretrained model files provided for reproducibility.

ðŸ“Œ Latest update: June 25, 2025

ðŸ§ª Coming soon:
We will also release our proposed PQD classification model in PyTorch after the acceptance of our submission to Applied Energy.
